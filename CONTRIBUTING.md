# How to submit your tip

To submit a tip to the list, fork the repository and add your tip in a new file in the correct folder (according language).  The name of the file should be `2016-xx-xx-name-of-your-tip`.

Use [this format](https://github.com/loverajoel/jstips/blob/gh-pages/POST_TEMPLATE.md) when writing your tip. 

### Requirements
- The tip should be readable in less than two minutes
- Adding links to other sites or videos that give more insight is welcome
- Mark JS code with ```js
- Capitalized title (see [here](http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/capitalization/rules-for-capitalization-in-titles.html) for how it works)
- Don't mention "JavaScript" in the title (as our tips are about it anyway)
- Use backticks (`) to mark code in the title ‐ _Warning_: Titles must not start with backticks!

Once your tip is ready, [issue a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with this [PR template](https://github.com/loverajoel/jstips/blob/gh-pages/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) and your tip will be reviewed (see below).

# Notes

Leave the date and the tip number with **xx**. When we decide to merge the pull request, you will add them and squash your commits.

# Tip flow

**Tip proposal** ⇒ **Tip under review** ⇒ **Tip ready to merge**

- When you send a tip, it has to pass the review process and while that happens, its status is `under-review`.
- After the tip had been reviewed by 5 people and they have given their ship it emote (:shipit:), the tip is `ready to merge`.


We are looking forward to your contribution!
